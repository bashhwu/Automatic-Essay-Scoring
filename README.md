# Automatic-Essay-Scoring


This repository contains two colab notebooks which implement pretrained Global vecors for word embeddings. These vectors are fine-tuned when the mode is trained. The first model uses Bidirectional LTSM and regression-based neural network to precit the score of persuasive essays (data set2) from ASAP Kaggle competition. The second model uses regrgression only algorithm to grade the essays of the data set 1.
